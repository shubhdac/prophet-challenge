This is the time series analysis of Mercado Libre's Google search trend and stock price data. This makes it possible to find out if predicting the search traffic can help in the successful trading of the stock
Summary
Start by finding unusual patterns in the Google search traffic. We look at the data from 2020 and then  compare the total search traffic to the median total search traffic across the whole dataset. Then, looking for seasonality in the search trends by analyzing the search traffic based on day of the week and week of the year. Next comes analyzing the stock price with the Google search trends to see if there are any correlating relationships between them. After that we use Prophet to train a machine learning model to make in and out of sample forecasts (80 days out of sample)
